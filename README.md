# Computer Graphics final project

This app has two top level modules:
- `engine`: 3D rendering engine that uses WebGL
- `app`: application specific logic

Engine module has a similar API to some other well known 3D rendering libraries like [Three.js](https://threejs.org/).

App module also has a few useful classes (located in [`app/sound`](./src/app/sound) module) that are used for retrieving, playing and analyzing sound data.

## Credits

A great part of the graphics engine source code was taken, modified and extended
from [UL-FRI-LGM/webgl2-examples](https://github.com/UL-FRI-LGM/webgl2-examples).
